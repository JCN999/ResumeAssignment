            <h3>Retail Associate</h3>
            <p>PacSun</p>
            <p>06/19 - 01/2021</p>
            <p>Working as a retail associate for nearly 2 years brought me communication skills which I felt are necessary for being a Web Designer/Graphic Designer. I say this because it allows me to communicate better with the customer, as well as bringing them a comfortable environment in which they feel that they have control.</p>

            <p>11/2022 - Current</p>
            <p>Working as a Server pushes you to be the best version of yourself possible. I constantly work with people every day, which allows me to work on my communication skills as well as strengthen them. It also allows me to prioritize my teamwork skills, which in return makes it much easier for me to work with anyone and everyone.</p>
